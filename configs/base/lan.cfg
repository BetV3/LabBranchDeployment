# LAN Configuration Template - Base with Extended Internal Segments
#
# This file defines the internal LAN segmentation parameters that are common
# to all campuses. It includes the base LAN block as well as specific subnets
# for various internal services.
#
# Variables:
#   LAN_BLOCK                - The primary LAN block assigned to the campus (e.g., "172.16.0.0/16")
#
# Extended Internal Segments:
#   LAN_CORE_SEGMENT         - Core infrastructure (e.g., ESXi hosts, vCenter, NSX managers,
#                              Domain Controllers, File Server). Example: "172.16.1.0/24"
#   LAN_SAN_SEGMENT          - Storage Area Network for SAN connectivity. Example: "172.16.12.0/24"
#   LAN_VMOTION_SEGMENT      - vMotion network segment. Example: "172.16.20.0/24"
#   LAN_LINUX_VM_SEGMENT     - Segment for Linux VMs. Example: "172.16.100.0/24"
#   LAN_WINDOWS_VM_SEGMENT   - Segment for Windows VMs (non-workstation/server). Example: "172.16.101.0/24"
#   LAN_BACKUP_SEGMENT       - Backup appliances (e.g., Veeam). Example: "172.16.15.0/24"
#   LAN_MONITORING_SEGMENT   - Monitoring systems (e.g., Grafana/Prometheus). Example: "172.16.16.0/24"
#   LAN_EDGE_SEGMENT         - NSX Edge appliances. Example: "172.16.19.0/24"
#
# Example default values for a Campus (e.g., Campus 1):
LAN_BLOCK="172.16.0.0/16"

# Extended Segments
LAN_CORE_SEGMENT="172.16.1.0/24"         # Core Infrastructure: ESXi, vCenter, NSX Managers, DCs, File Server
LAN_SAN_SEGMENT="172.16.12.0/24"         # SAN for storage connectivity
LAN_VMOTION_SEGMENT="172.16.20.0/24"     # vMotion network for live migrations
LAN_LINUX_VM_SEGMENT="172.16.100.0/24"   # Linux VM network
LAN_WINDOWS_VM_SEGMENT="172.16.101.0/24" # Windows VM network
LAN_BACKUP_SEGMENT="172.16.15.0/24"       # Backup Appliances (e.g., Veeam)
LAN_MONITORING_SEGMENT="172.16.16.0/24"   # Monitoring (e.g., Grafana/Prometheus)
LAN_EDGE_SEGMENT="172.16.19.0/24"         # NSX Edge Appliances

# This file serves as the base template. Campus-specific variable files can override these
# settings to apply the appropriate addressing for each campus (e.g., using different base addresses).

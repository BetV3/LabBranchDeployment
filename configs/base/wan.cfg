# WAN Configuration Template - Base
#
# This file provides default settings for WAN connectivity.
# It is intended to be merged with campus-specific variables to generate
# final configurations during automation.
#
# Variables:
#   WAN_SUBNET       - The WAN subnet allocated to the campus (e.g., "192.168.0.0/24")
#   WAN_VIP          - The Virtual IP for the WAN used for redundancy (e.g., "192.168.0.1")
#   ROUTER_PRIMARY   - The primary router's WAN IP (e.g., "192.168.0.2")
#   ROUTER_BACKUP    - The backup router's WAN IP (e.g., "192.168.0.3")
#
# Example values for Campus 1 might be:
WAN_SUBNET="192.168.0.0/24"
WAN_VIP="192.168.0.1"
ROUTER_PRIMARY="192.168.0.2"
ROUTER_BACKUP="192.168.0.3"

# This file is a template. The automation engine will combine these
# defaults with campus-specific values found in the campus variable files.
